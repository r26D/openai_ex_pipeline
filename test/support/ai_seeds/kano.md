title: Kano Model
---

The **Kano Model** is a framework for understanding how different product features influence user satisfaction. It categorizes features into five main types:

1. **Basic Needs (Must-Have Features)** – These are fundamental expectations. If they are missing, users will be dissatisfied, but their presence doesn’t necessarily increase satisfaction.  
   *Example: A login system for an email application. Users expect it; they don’t get excited about it.*

2. **Performance Needs (Linear Features)** – These features have a direct correlation with satisfaction. The better they are implemented, the more satisfied the user is.  
   *Example: Faster email search in an inbox—better speed leads to happier users.*

3. **Excitement Needs (Delighters)** – These are unexpected but delightful features that create significant user satisfaction. Their absence doesn’t cause dissatisfaction because users don’t expect them.  
   *Example: An AI assistant that auto-summarizes long email threads in MailBoxer.*

4. **Indifferent Features** – Features that users neither like nor dislike. They don’t impact satisfaction.  
   *Example: A niche customization option that few users care about.*

5. **Reverse Features** – Features that some users love, but others hate.  
   *Example: Aggressive email categorization that some find helpful but others find intrusive.*
